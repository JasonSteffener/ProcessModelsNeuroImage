%% The aim of this example is to demonstrate a setup of this software.
% This will be an incremental step example. 
% First, will be a simple mediation analysis where the effect of age group
% on a behavioral performance measure is mediated by a voxel-wise measure
% of grey matter density.

% To begin, start by loading up the brain data. 
P = spm_select(Inf,'image','Select the imaging data which will serve as the mediator.');
V = spm_vol(P);
I = spm_read_vols(V);
% The format of the input data is needed for later writing of the output
% images
DataHeader = V(1);

% A mask image is needed. From this mask image the indices of voxels to
% include is determined.
% MASK
MaskFlag = 0;
while MaskFlag == 0
    Pmask = spm_select(1,'image','Select the mask image');
    Vmask = spm_vol(Pmask);
    Imask = spm_read_vols(Vmask);
    % make sure the selected mask has the same dimensions as the data
    if false(Vmask.dim == V(1).dim)
        errordlg('The mask is not the same size as the selected data');
    end
    % make sure the mask image is really a mask image
    if length(unique(Imask)) > 2
        errordlg('The mask image selected has more then two unique values.');
    else
        % Find the indices of the voxels included inthe mask
        Indices = find(Imask);
        clear Imask Vmask
        MaskFlag = 1;
    end
end
% determine the size of the data
Nvoxels = length(Indices);
Nsub = size(I,4);
% restructure the imaging data to be a Nvoxels X NSub matrix
NIData = zeros(Nsub, Nvoxels);
for i = 1:Nsub
    temp = I(:,:,:,i);
    NIData(i,:) = temp(Indices)';
end
% Clean up the memory
clear temp I 

% For this example the behavioral data is a single number per person.
% Behavioral Data

COVARIATES = randn(Nsub,2);

fprintf(1,'Done preparing data.\n');

%% General Setup
% The base directory is the folder containg the folder of results. The
% results for a specific analysis will all be in folders contained within
% this base directory. The output folders are named according to a
% user specified "Tag" name.

% Check to see whether this example is running on my laptop or desktop.
% This will have to be changed for any specific user.

end

% Create a structure where each cell is a node in the path diagram. This
% could be a voxel-wise matrix or a vector.
data = {};
data{1} = AgeGroup;
data{2} = NIData;
data{3} = BEHAVIOR;

% Create a structure of corresponding names for each cell in the data
% structure
Names = {};

Names{2} = 'Brain';
Names{3} = 'Behavior';

% How many variables were entered
Nvar = length(data);

% Right now the statistics can be performed at the voxel-level using bias
% correctsed accelerated confidence intervals determined from bootstrap
% resampling.
% Are there any voxel-wise bootstrap resamplings?
Nboot = 100;

% An alternative to voxel-wise statistics is a map-wise statistics based
% off of the maximum statistic approach from a series of permutation
% resamples. This approach performs the voxel-wise calculations, then
% identifiies the value of the maximal statistic in the image. This is
% redone with each permutation to create a distribution of maximal
% statistical values. These values are sorted and the percentiles are
% determined based onthe number of permutations and the thresholds. Note,
% two-tailed thresholds are used.
% Are there any permutaion resamples to perform?
Nperm = 0;

% The job split variable is how many jobs this analysis is split into for
% sending to a comuputer cluster environment. Note that the more splits
% does not mean faster computing because there is a limitationon the number
% of available cluster nodes. When the number of job splits exceeds the
% number of available jobs then jobs are placed in the queue and need to
% wait.
% If you are running this on a single (non-cluster environment) computer
% then set this to equal 1.
NJobSplit = 1;

% Specify the thresholds used in the analysis. 
% Some of the images and results in the mediation analysis perform
% parametric tests where the threshold can be more dynamically changed.
% However, for  estimation of the significance of the paths resampling
% methods are required and the probabilities need to be calculated at the
% time of the bootstrapping and therefore, made a prior.

% Startification is used when the resamples are created and needs to be a
% binomial parameter for right now. The use of a stratification variable is
% so that when the reampling is performed each resample maintains the

% (Age group) and a continuous variable (Behavior).

% The first model is a basic mediation model testing whether the effect of age
% group on behavior is mediated by the voxel-wise brain measures.


% The modeling is specified using a series of matrices. The first is the
% DIRECT matrix. This matrix is square with dimension based onthe number of
% variables in the model. The rows and columns refer to the variabvles in
% the model in the same order as they are specified in the data matrix.
% Since the path analyses are in fact a series of regression models these
% models get specified in DIRECT matrix. Interaction or moderating effects
% get specified in the INTER(actions) matrix below.

% A simple mediation model would be: 
% VAR_2 = VAR_1
% VAR_3 = VAR_1 + VAR_2

Direct = zeros(Model1.Nvar);
Direct(1,[2 3]) = 1;
Direct(2,3) = 1;

% To specify interactions in the model create another matrix the same size
% as the DIRECT matrix.
% An interaction between two variables in predicting a third, the rows
% of the interacting variables will both have a value of one within the
% column of the variable they are predicting. Be sure to include in the
% DIRECT matrix the main effects for each of these variables on the
% predicted variable.

% For this model there are no interactions so this is kept as a zero
% matrix.
Inter = zeros(Model1.Nvar);

% The paths to be tested are included in another matrix the same size of
% the DIRECT matrix. One difference here is that the PATHS matrix may have
% a third dimension to test multiple paths within a single model. The steps
% along a path are specified with integers, i.e. step 1, step 2 ...
Paths = zeros(Model1.Nvar);
Paths(1,2) = 1;
Paths(2,3) = 2;


Model1.Direct = Direct;
Model1.Inter = Inter;
Model1.Paths = Paths;

%% Run the analysis for Model 1
% The following two functions actually run the mediation analysis and then
% writes out the results to NIFTI format images.

ResultsFolder = PrepareDataForProcess(Model1);

% The writing of the images should ideally be perfomed by the cluster once
% the analyses have completed. Therefore, a check is needed or better yet a
% wait command for the cluster job:

%% Model Specific Setup Number 2

% voxel-wise brain data as the mediation between a dichotomous variable
% (Age group) and a continuous variable (Behavior). This analysis now
% includes covariates also.

%% Model Specific Setup Number Three
% The third model is to perform a moderated-mediation analysis with the
% voxel-wise brain data as the mediation between a dichotomous variable
% (Age group) and a continuous variable (Behavior). 
% Now there is an interaction between the brain measure and age group in
